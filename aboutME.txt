This is the first python project from Codecademy. I am going to create a mortgage calculator that will take the price of the house you are looking at and calculate monthly payments. 

Again, I have no idea what I'm doing.

Outline of program:

Intro:

Display text welcoming user to CS Mortgage Calculator
Ask user to input the price of the home they want to buy.
Ask user for amount of downpayment if any
Fixed 30 year mortgage 
Annual interest rate fixed at 4.5%
Annual Property tax = $2500
Annual Property insurance = $1500

Program:

Example - If one borrows $250,000 at a 7% annual interest rate and pays the loan back over thirty years, with $3,000 annual property tax payment, $1,500 annual property insurance cost and 0.5% annual private mortgage insurance payment, what will the monthly payment be? The answer is $2,142.42.

Formula calculates:
P = principal amount   user input 
DP = downpayment       user input 
R = interest rate 4.5 / 100 / 12 
N = monthly payments 30 * 12 = 360



M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n â€“ 1]


Conclusion:

Print statement telling the user how much their monthly payment will be 

Ask if they would like to check another house payment - if yes start over.
